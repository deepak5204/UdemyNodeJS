## Working with Default and Check
## AGGREGATION PIPELINE

```bash
    Aggregation is a way of processing a large amount of documents in a collection by means of passing them through different stages.

    In other words, Aggregation is very similar to the find command, where you provide the criteria for your query in form of JSON documents.

    >> The key element in aggregation is called pipeline.

    >> It also helps us in perform few operations like min, max, sum etc.

```


### command
    db.collection.aggregate(pipeline)
